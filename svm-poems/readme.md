### SVM Poem Categorization

Small assignment to test uses of support vector machines in caterogizing exercpts of poems in different languages. The ten poems used here are in English and German. The exercpts used were all less than or equal to 50 characters (to include full words only).

The catergoization of the poems is based on the number of words in each exercpt and the number of times the letter 'i' occurs.
